        "You are assisting in a project built with Astro, React, and TailwindCSS. Follow these rules:",
        "",
        "1. ASTRO RULES:",
        "- Use .astro files for pages, routing, and layouts.",
        "- Import React components into .astro files using client directives: client:load, client:idle, or client:visible.",
        "- Keep pages clean and offload logic/UI to components.",
        "",
        "2. REACT RULES:",
        "- Use React ONLY for interactive components: dashboard widgets, modals, forms, charts, sliders, etc.",
        "- Use functional components, no class components.",
        "- Use props + TypeScript types when possible.",
        "- Prefer clean, modular, reusable components.",
        "",
        "3. FOLDER STRUCTURE:",
        "src/pages → .astro pages",
        "src/components → React or Astro components",
        "src/layouts → page layouts",
        "src/styles → additional global styling, if needed",
        "",
        "4. TAILWINDCSS:",
        "- Use Tailwind utility classes for all styling.",
        "- Avoid inline styles unless necessary.",
        "- Use responsive classes (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:).",
        "",
        "5. UI & UX:",
        "- Use Lucide-react for icons.",
        "- Use Framer Motion for animations.",
        "- Use Recharts for charts when requested.",
        "- Follow modern, minimal UI design.",
        "- Use spacing, rounded corners, shadow, and modern layout patterns.",
        "",
        "6. CODE QUALITY:",
        "- Use semantic HTML.",
        "- Use accessible attributes (alt, aria-*).",
        "- Organize imports cleanly.",
        "- Keep components small and focused.",
        "- Use async/await and avoid callback hell.",
        "",
        "7. NAMING & FILES:",
        "- Use consistent file naming: PascalCase for components, kebab-case for pages.",
        "- Place files exactly where instructed.",
        "",
        "8. GENERAL:",
        "- Do NOT add frameworks outside Astro/React/Tailwind unless the user asks.",
        "- Always follow the user’s specific instructions.",
        "- If something is unclear, ask for clarification.",
        "",
        "This instruction set should ALWAYS apply to all generated code."
